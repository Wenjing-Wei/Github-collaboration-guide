# Github Collaboration Workflow

The goal for this activity is to practice Github collaboration with branching. We'll be creating separate branches to do our work and then merging out work back in to the `main` branch. 

Split into groups of two and pick one team member to be Team Member A and one to be Team Member B.

## Set Up
1. Have Team Member A share their screen and create a brand new repo in Github.
    - Make it public
    - do not add a readme or any files on initialization

1. Team Member A can then add **Collaborators** to the repo.
    - settings tab > Manage access > Invite a collaborator
    - search for your partner by their Github username
    - add your partern
    - Team Member B can then check their email and accept the invitation

1. Have Team Member A create the project boilerplate.
    - Team Member A clones down the empty repo to their local machine.
    - Team Member A creates an HTML file and adds some basic code.
    - Team Member A adds and commits their work.
    - `git push origin main`

1. Have Team Member B clone down the project.

## Workflow for Adding a Feature

Pick one team member to share their screen while going through the following steps to add a feature.

- verify you are on the main branch
    - `git branch`

- If you are not on the main branch
    - `git checkout main`

- create a new working branch of off the main branch
    - `git checkout -b <branch name>` (replace `<branch name>` with what you'd like to name your branch)

- make edits.

- Git add, Commit.

- checkout **main** and verify the **main** branch is up to date.
    - `git checkout main`
    - `git pull origin main`

- **IF THERE ARE UPDATES** to **main** merge updates to your working branch.
    - `git checkout <branch name>` (i.e. your working branch)
    - `git merge main`
    - `git push origin <branch name>`

- **IF THERE ARE NO UPDATES** to **main**, checkout your working branch and push to origin.
    - `git checkout <branch name>`
    - `git push origin <branch name>`

- go to public repo on github and create a new pull request from **Your Branch** to **main**.

- ask a team member to verify the work in your pull request looks good.

- **If all team mates agree** and **there are no conflicts**, Team Member B merge the pull request.

- Make sure everyone knows there are new changes available to be pulled down.

- **EVERYONE** (including team member making the changes) save edits to their working branch and and update all local branches.

    - `git add -A && git commit -m "message"` in working branch.

    - `git checkout main`

    - `git pull origin main` (resolve conflicts if any)

    - `git checkout <branch name>` (your working branch)

    - `git merge main`

Repeat [Workflow for Adding a Feature](#workflow-for-adding-a-feature) now with the other team member adding a feature. Continue alternating [Workflow for Adding a Feature](#workflow-for-adding-a-feature) with one team member adding a feature and then the other team member adding a feature.
